[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frankkoch/moodle-mod_studentquiz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frankkoch/moodle-mod_studentquiz "Travis")

Students like self-assessments in order to prepare for exams. However, 
it’s hard to provide all the many questions needed. That’s one reason 
why the [University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil](https://www.hsr.ch/de/) developed the 
Moodle plugin StudentQuiz. StudentQuiz enables students to collaboratively 
create their own question pools within Moodle. Even if an individual student 
contributes a few questions only, a large cohort could easily build up an 
extensive question pool.

In StudentQuiz, students can filter questions into quizzes, and they can rate 
and comment on questions while working through the quizzes. StudentQuiz 
collects usage data for each question and ranks students based on their 
contribution and performance within the quizzes. A personal learning assistance 
feature displays the individual progress and compares it with the community 
average. The created questions become part of the Moodle question bank and can 
be reused in other Moodle quizzes.

A teacher can configure:
- whether StudentQuiz runs anonymously or displays student names.
- whether students can rate and comment on questions.
- what questions types are allowed to be added to the pool.
- the number of points assigned to questions contributed and answers given.
