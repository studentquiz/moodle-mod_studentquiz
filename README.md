Students like self-assessments in order to prepare for exams. However, it’s hard to provide all the many questions
needed. That’s one reason why the [University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil](https://www.hsr.ch/de/) developed the
Moodle plugin StudentQuiz. StudentQuiz enables students to collaboratively create their own question pools within
Moodle. Even if an individual student contributes a few questions only, a large cohort could easily build up an
extensive question pool.

In StudentQuiz, students can filter questions into quizzes, and they can rate and comment on questions while working
through the quizzes. StudentQuiz collects usage data for each question and ranks students based on their contribution
and performance within the quizzes. A personal learning assistance feature displays the individual progress and compares
it with the community average. The created questions become part of the Moodle question bank and can be reused in other
Moodle quizzes.

A teacher can configure:

- whether StudentQuiz runs anonymously or displays student names.
- whether students can rate and comment on questions.
- what questions types are allowed to be added to the pool.
- the number of points assigned to questions contributed and answers given.
