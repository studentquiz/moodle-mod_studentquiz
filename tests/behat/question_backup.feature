  Scenario: Restore a Studentquiz 2.0.3 xml backup
    When I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "StudentQuiz 1"
    And I navigate to "Import" in current page administration
    #And I set the field "format" to "xml" #seems not to work, thus workaround:
    And I click on "#id_format_xml" "css_element"
    And I upload "mod/studentquiz/tests/fixtures/studentquiz-export-v2.0.3.xml" file to "Import" filemanager
    #The "Import" button is not the only clickable item with a text beginning with "Import", so need to specify exactly
    And I click on "#id_submitbutton" "css_element"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    And I should see "Importing 323 questions from file"
